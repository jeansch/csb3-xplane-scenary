This is a small GA field east of Montreal in the town of Beloeil, Quebec, Canada. It has some helicopter services and quite a lot of GA aircraft activity.

The approach to 15 involves negotiating the Trans-Canada Hwy, which is right near the end of the runway, and has some tall lighting poles that might get in your way! With the big highways and the Riviere Richelieu nearby, CSB3 St Mathieu-de-Beloeil is ideal for a bit of GA pattern flying.

Happy flying!
